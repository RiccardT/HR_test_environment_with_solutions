My HackerRank Interview Prep Kit Solution Stash!
-------
This is my stash/ proving ground of solutions and unit tests to the Hacker Rank Interview 
Prep Kit. The reason for it's existence are to:

- Keep my Data Structures & Algorithms skills sharp
- Practice the things I'm learning from Robert C. Martin's excellent book: "Clean Code"
- Hone my test driven development habits
- Sharpen my Python Zen (God bless Guido Von Rossum <3)
- Provide a place for my friends to get help with their run through of the problems
- Show potential employers my code habits

The code stash is divided up into different topics from data structures & algorithms,i.e., 
sorting, arrays, greedy algorithms, etc.

It is further divided into easy, medium, hard, and advanced problem sets for each topic. 

Some problems from the HackerRank Interview Prep Kit are omitted from here since they were,
at least for me, too easy to warrant a full test suite + file structure and were solved
within hacker rank's awesome integrated web IDE (which is awesome). 

Feel free to shoot me any questions regarding this repo! Happy coding! <3
