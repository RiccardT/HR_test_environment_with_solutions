A string is said to be a child of a another string if it can be formed by
deleting 0 or more characters from the other string. Given two strings of
equal length, what's the longest string that can be constructed such that 
it is a child of both?

Essentially, what's the longest common subsequence?

### Function Description

Complete the commonChild function. It should return the longest string which is a common child of the input strings.

commonChild has the following parameter(s):

s1, s2: two equal length strings

## Note

This problem was HARD! It requires a great knowledge of recursion and dynamic programming to solve! What a ride :D
