Karl loves playing games on social networking sites. His current favorite is CandyMaker, where the goal is to make candies.

Karl just started a level in which he must accumulate n candies starting with m machines and w workers. In a single pass, 
he can make m*w candies. After each pass, he can decide whether to spend some of his candies to buy more machines or hire 
more workers. Buying a machine or hiring a worker costs p units, and there is no limit to the number of machines he can 
own or workers he can employ.

Karl wants to minimize the number of passes to obtain the required number of candies at the end of a day. Determine that 
number of passes.
###Function Description
Complete the minimumPasses function in the editor below. The function must return a long integer representing the minimum 
number of passes required.

minimumPasses has the following parameter(s):

- m: long integer, the starting number of machines
- w: long integer, the starting number of workers
- p: long integer, the cost of a new hire or a new machine
- n: long integer, the number of candies to produce

###Input Format
A single line consisting of four space-separated integers describing the values of m, w, p, and n, the starting number of 
machines and workers, the cost of a new machine or a new hire, and the the number of candies Karl must accumulate to 
complete the level.

###Output Format
Return a long integer denoting the minimum number of passes required to accumulate at least n candies.

###Caveats
I have not created any solution to this problem :/ However, the test cases run so feel free to take up that challenge :)
